# RoSA Dataset
**Abstract.** Current research on road construction environment perception
primarily focuses on the detection of objects and signs indicating
roadwork. However, this approach requires an additional cognitive step
for drivers to fully recognize the extent of construction areas, complicating
immediate recognition, especially on highways. Identifying the
start of construction zones from a distance is crucial for safe and flexible
vehicle rerouting. Existing object detection methods face challenges in
identifying these zones from afar due to the small size of marker cones,
known as lava cones, which are often spaced widely apart. This can lead
to navigational issues when vehicles traverse these gaps. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel method that segments construction areas
in video footage collectively, enabling the detection of continuous zones
from a distance. This approach allows vehicles to adjust their driving
paths safely and efficiently. We intend to release a subset of these images
with corresponding labeling data to contribute to the field.
